This is a little plugin for [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser)

It add a `browser-note` command to qutebrowser that takes a note using currently selected text  
and then it invokes `my-browser-note-save` program to handle note text and related metadata (page title, date, page url, ..)
