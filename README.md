This is a little plugin for [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser)

It adds a `browser-note` command to qutebrowser that takes a note using currently selected text (can be None) and saves all information about the context.

# HOWTO

Run `$ make install TARGET=~/path/to/config.py` which will add an import of `note_save.py`.
